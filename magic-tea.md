# Magic Tea (except it's not magic, it's science)
Brought to you by Samantha Guinn

## Ingredients:
- ~1L water
- 1 Lemon (zest and juice)
- Fresh ginger root (cut into about 10-12 thin slices)
- 10 Cardamon pods (halved)
- 4 Cloves
- Cinnamon stick (broken up)
- 1tsp Coriander seeds

## Method:
1. Put water in a pot.
2. Bring to a hearty boil. 
3. Put ingredients in a pot. *(If you put in the lemon juice first it won't spit at you so much when you dump the other stuff in.)*
4. Bring back to boil, then simmer the brew. 
5. Wait until it reduces by about half (~40-60 mins).
6. Put some of the brew in a mug.
7. Add honey to taste. 
8. Feel better. 

## NOTE:
The fresh ginger and lemon are the key ingredients for medicinal purposes. You can fudge the others if you don't have that stuff.
